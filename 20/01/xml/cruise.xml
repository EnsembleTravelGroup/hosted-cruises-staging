				<p>Austria&rsquo;s iconic Wachau Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is not only home to some of the most charming towns and villages but also stunning scenic views and lush, steeply terraced vineyards.</p>
				<p><br />And one of the most enjoyable ways to revel in the area&rsquo;s great beauty is with a sip of its superb wine: the Wachau is one of the world&rsquo;s most exciting wine regions. Stretching along the Danube between the legendary towns of Melk and Krems, the region specializes in dry, white wines that are among the best in the world.</p>
				<p><br />Locally grown Rieslings and Gr&uuml;ner Veltliners are especially renowned and you&rsquo;ll get the opportunity to sample a few. After you take the ship&rsquo;s morning tour &ldquo;Highlights of Durnstein &amp; Melk Abbey,&rdquo; your private Ensemble Experience will then depart from Melk for a scenic drive through the fabled Wachau Valley celebrated for its cultural landscape, fairy-tale-like settings and castles, as well as glorious vistas and vintages.</p>
				<p><br />You&rsquo;ll visit the historic Klosterhof located in Spitz, one of the oldest and loveliest wine-making villages in the Wachau Valley. The atmospheric Austrian estate dates back to the 12th century and was once the wine press house of St. Gottweig Abbey. Here you&rsquo;ll be treated to a tasting event highlighting four distinctive vintages.</p>
				<p><br />You&rsquo;ll also savor regional culinary flavors with a lunch of local specialties. Afterwards, you&rsquo;ll drive along the majestic Danube to meet your ship in Grein, where you can join the ship&rsquo;s tour of Greinburg Castle, Austria&rsquo;s oldest residential castle.</p>

				<p>Gateway to the Upper Middle Rhine Valley, a UNESCO World Heritage site, Rudesheim is also renowned for terraced vineyards which produce excellent wines.</p>
				<p>In the heart of its old town is the Drossel-gasse, the famous medieval lane lined with traditional taverns, colorful shops and R&uuml;desheimer Schloss &ndash; a cozy wine restaurant where your Ensemble Experience will treat you to an authentic taste of German Rhine culture.</p>
				<p>A perfect ending to a day of sightseeing, this almost 300-year-old setting provides one of the best dining experiences in Rudesheim. Its historic charm as well as its timeless culinary traditions have made it a long-time favorite.</p>
				<p>Here, delicious regional specialties are accompanied by local wines such as Riesling and Pinot Noir wines from the family Breuer vineyard and other local Rheingau winegrowers.</p>
				<p>Everything about this inviting locale exudes warmth, from its amber lighting to its colorful stained glass to its flavorful wines and heartwarming menu.</p>
				<p>For dinner you can savor local German flavors with favorites which may include homemade potato soup, followed by a typical Rheingau dish, such as trout cooked in melted butter and almonds with potatoes, or wild boar goulash with spaetzle; ending with dessert such as apple strudel with ice cream.</p>
				<p>Of course the evening will be capped off with the famous Rudesheimer Kaffee, the specialty coffee which has become one of Rudesheim&rsquo;s historical highlights.</p>

				<p>Perched on a terrace overlooking the sea, Taormina has a delightful medieval character and is well known all over the world as one of the most beautiful spots in Sicily.</p>
                <p>Your <em>Ensemble Experience</em> will begin aboard a deluxe motor coach. After a short drive through the center of Giardini Naxos, the first Greek colony established in Sicily in 734 B.C., and along the coast, you&rsquo;ll wind up on a scenic route which takes you to Taormina. Leaving your coach at the parking lot, you&rsquo;ll then continue on foot.</p>
                <p>Following your guide, you&rsquo;ll reach <strong>Casa Cuseni, the most prestigious villa </strong>in the city of Taormina. Due to its highly elevated historic and artistic value, it&rsquo;s been declared <strong>a National Italian Monument</strong>. The villa was constructed in the early twentieth century by Robert H. Kitson, and is surrounded by an enchanting and historical garden, with 13 panoramic terraces that face the Bay of Giardini Naxos and Mount Etna.</p>
                <p>When Robert H. Kitson died in 1947, the House was inherited by his niece, who transformed part of the residence into a special museum in memory of her uncle who was a painter, and the other part into the first and only hotel for artists in Italy. The historic garden is part of the 124 Grandi Giardini Italiani (Grand Italian Gardens).</p>
                <p>After your visit, a<strong> refreshment will be served on the terrace</strong>.</p>
                <p>Then you&rsquo;ll <strong>continue your guided stroll through the main street</strong>, Corso Umberto with stops at the Cathedral (outside visit),</p>
                <p>IX Aprile square and a view of the Palazzo Corvaja from the exterior.</p>
                <p>Finally, there will <strong>be some free time to do some shopping or wander</strong> around savoring the particular charm and atmosphere of this small medieval town, before meeting your guide and walking to the parking lot for the drive back to your ship.</p>

            <p>A lively blend of French and English cultures, St. George's has steep hills and spectacular views, perfumed with the heady scents of nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. You&rsquo;ll also find mountain waterfalls, white-sand beaches and lagoons of mottled blues. Grenada, "The Isle of Spice&rdquo;, has more spices per square mile than any other place in the world.</p>
            
            <p>Your <em>Ensemble Experience</em> begins with a <strong>drive through St. George&rsquo;s, Grenada&rsquo;s capital</strong>. From the quaint town of red tiled roofs and spice markets you&rsquo;ll climb up to historic Fort Frederick for a panoramic view of St. George&rsquo;s and your ship in the harbor.</p>
            
            <p>Your next stop, at <strong>Grand Etang National Park, has one of the most dramatic views in the Caribbean</strong> overlooking shimmering Grand Etang Lake. This cobalt blue, extinct volcano crater lake is situated a breathtaking 1900 ft above sea level. While here you may get a glimpse of the rare Mona Monkey.</p>
            <p>From the Park your scenic drive will take you to the <strong>authentic 17th century plantation of Belmont Estate</strong> to observe the workings of a fully functional historic plantation.</p>
            
            <p>Here you&rsquo;ll be fascinated with captivating displays that document Grenada&rsquo;s traditions and intriguing history. You&rsquo;ll enjoy the best of true Grenadian hospitality and its breath-taking surroundings as you <strong>feast on a</strong> <strong>delicious lunch with a Grenadian flavor</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>After, stroll through the plantation&rsquo;s tropical gardens before leaving to visit the oldest functioning water wheel in the Western hemisphere, at the <strong>River Antoine Sugar Estate and rum distillery</strong>. After a delightful tour to see the age-old rum making process, you&rsquo;ll have the chance to sample the rum.</p>
            
            <p>Then driving back to the pier, you&rsquo;ll see the final snippets of Grenada&rsquo;s colorful history, including relics of the 1979 revolution.</p>
