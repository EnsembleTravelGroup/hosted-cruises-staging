				<p>On this Ensemble Experience, you&rsquo;ll <strong>head off the beaten track </strong>to a lesser known area of the beautiful Cote d&rsquo;Azur region. Relax on your coach and enjoy the scenic uphill drive towards the pre-alp mountains and <strong>the picturesque village of Sainte-Agn&egrave;s</strong>.</p>
				<p>Perched overlooking the sea and mountains, this <strong>medieval hidden gem </strong>claims to be the highest coastal village in Europe. Sainte-Agn&egrave;s is also <strong>classified as one of the most beautiful villages in France</strong>. The coach will drop you at the foot of the village and you can enjoy a nice uphill walk to a vista point overlooking the Mediterranean Sea, before entering <strong>the historical Fort Maginot</strong>.</p>
				<p>A local historian will guide you through this military fort, created between 1932 and 1938 to protect the French border. It&rsquo;s <strong>part of the famous &ldquo;Maginot Line&rdquo; fortification </strong>which was built during the 1st and 2nd World Wars,&nbsp;starting at the Mediterranean Sea, along the Italian, Swiss and German borders all the way to Luxembourg.</p>
				<p><strong>Discover the underground rooms with state-of-the-art equipment </strong>for the time. Although the village only had running water and sewerage in 1960, the fort had these amenities as early as 1938. In addition, a power plant supplied central heating, telephone, regulated air and a neutralization room against combat gas. The Fort could accommodate 350 troops living there in complete self-sufficiency for 3 months.</p>
				<p>A short documentary video will give you more details about the history of the occupation in Sainte Agn&egrave;s.</p>
				<p>Afterwards<strong>, enjoy some time to stroll </strong>around the charming village before savoring some <strong>refreshments at a local restaurant</strong>.</p>
